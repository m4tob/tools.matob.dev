## 🚀 What is this?

**Tools by Matob** is a lightweight, responsive, and extensible tool directory made with plain HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It gathers links to useful online services categorized into:

- 📦 **Conversion & Compression**  
- 📋 **Lists & Data**  
- 🌐 **Web Tools**  
- 🎨 **Visual Resources**

Each tool includes an icon, a description, and a direct link. It’s designed to be fast, no-nonsense, and easy to update.

## 🧱 How it works

All sections and tools are defined in a single `data.js` file, then rendered dynamically into the page using vanilla JavaScript.

Want to add a new tool? Just edit the JSON-like data structure — no need to touch the HTML!
